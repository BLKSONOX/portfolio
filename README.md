What does a programming language need:

Objects, arrays, math operators, if else, switch, functions, string operation to objects or arrays, loops
string operations, and type definition, the rest is just read or write various byte code matrixes

Three modes
compiler
runtime interpetator
static interpetator

1 and 3 are lock files

A compiler, static, runtime is just: either a set of multiplication tables from various number systems or just an exponent matrice of an octal and differentials within that
there's more complex variations of with partitioning, adding, substracting or binary tree

it's as simple as, an elementary school student would understand how to put it together 

interpeter either string serialization which is pretty much straight forward
or byte serialization towards ASCII mapped characters

the sum of that with numbers is a hexidecimal

----------------
12345678910111213141516

number rows pointer to the matrice, usually converted into multiplication tables crossed

that simple, the rest of the math or proofing is within the exponent range of the octal to find number bases, ratios etc

what does a server need; networkscard, CPU, RAM, keyboard, mouse, and VGA console mode

Thinking projects, thinking exersizes:
what does a web browser actually need to do?

read HTML files, css files and javascript files
it's more complicated but however; "print out and let user draw on viewport"

The browsers might have a bloat problem still, codebase extremely tied to user interface
"everything machine"

we need profilers

it's bloated, and i know why, sepparating of objects through UI/UX is ducktaped
it creates a ton of draw bugs and document render bugs

thinking exersize; you have a frame, that frame does alot of things, what's needed in that frame? and how much can just be that frame draw?

they're still using UI/UX kits and not direct draw on the frame
dropping that might sort the current bloating issues
