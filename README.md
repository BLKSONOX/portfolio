What does a programming language need:

Objects, arrays, math operators, if else, switch, string operation to objects or arrays
string operations, and type definition, the rest is just read or write various byte code matrixes

Three modes
compiler
runtime interpetator
static interpetator

1 and 3 are lock files

A compiler, static, runtime is just: either a set of multiplication tables from various number systems or just an exponent matrice of an octal and differentials within that
there's more complex variations of with partitioning, adding, substracting or binary tree

it's as simple as, an elementary school student would understand how to put it together 

interpeter either string serialization which is pretty much straight forward
or byte serialization towards ASCII mapped characters

the sum of that with numbers is a hexidecimal

12345678910111213141516

number rows pointer to the matrice, usually converted into multiplication tables crossed

that simple, the rest of the math or proofing is within the exponent range of the octal to find number bases, ratios etc
