What does a programming language need:

Objects, arrays, math operators, if else, switch, string operation to objects or arrays
string operations, and type definition, the rest is just read or write various byte code matrixes

Three modes
compiler
runtime interpetator
static interpetator

1 and 3 are lock files

A compiler, static, runtime is just: either a set of multiplication tables from various number systems or just an exponent matrice of an octal and differentials within that
there's more complex variations of with partitioning, adding, substracting or binary tree

it's as simple as, an elementary school student would understand how to put it together
