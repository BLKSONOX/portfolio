      <h3>in society we contemplate and watch people with money and regard that as power
        in society we contemplate social networks and regard that as power
        in society we contemplate hiarchy and regard that as power
        but those who stand against those lingustic notions rooted in pathos what's their definitions?
        <br><br>

        it's a linguistic notion nothing more and less, same abstract flat land as politics,
        power is a definition problem, who defines power?
        <br/><br/>

        it's linguistic consensus mechanisms, in agreement of, that's all it is
        standing against a language definition of, that's power, that's more psychological power then the ones having consenual notions of agreements of
        the power, in its actions and inactions

        <br/><br/>
        "For every action there's an equal amount of inaction"<br/>
        there's more power in that quote then all notions of power
