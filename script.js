                Distinguishing from decimal
                In contexts where the base is not clear, hexadecimal numbers can be ambiguous and confused with numbers expressed in other bases. 
                There are several conventions for expressing values unambiguously.
                A numerical subscript (itself written in decimal) can give the base explicitly: 15910 is decimal 159; 15916 is hexadecimal 159, which equals 34510. 
                Some authors prefer a text subscript, such as 159decimal and 159hex, or 159d and 159h. "

                a pointer is a circle, hex stream of that circle is the primitives created from

                there's other ways of doing the conversion table Octal, Decimal, Hexidecimal

                "my hex dump is not the same as your hex dump, my ooctal, decimal, hexidecimal conversion is not the same as your conversion"

                as long as the addresses stays the same, the conversion models can be whatever you like between; ooctal, decimal, hexidecimal 
                https://byjus.com/maths/hexadecimal-number-system/

                also useful for filesystem partionion tables and read and write block addresses

    Look up the program would look exactly like an object oriented C program 
    C is as loosleey typed as Javascript in its nature
    pointers, structs, functions, pointer arrays, nested functions, similar scope structures
    basically the same with syntax variation

    escaping and entering scopes would be pointer manipulation
    with struct and bind manipulations

    this JS document:

    <object>
       <constructor>(property)
            <function>
            <struct>(property)
                <function>
            <struct>(property)
        <struct>(property)
            <function>

    how interfaces are made, this approch declares the whole structure as interfaces
    and is C friendly

    a private function would be an anonoymous or named function within the struct and method
    binding to the object tree declared visible or not, where event loops and call back functions tend to get called

    same as C, basically JavaScript is C if followed properly according to standards, all the additional functions and classes one would otherwise create for most
    C project on repeat, with minimal variation of syntax and dialect

    added as its own language

    Additional resources and thoughts:

    A struct, is a class type object structure from 1968  
    ALGOL 68 language which C is derrived from 
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language)

    pointer chains and struct chains behave similarly slightly different
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming)

    writing ones own JavScript language spesific engine is alignment and transfer of
    according to standards

    https://tc39.es/ecma262/

    a JavaScript clone is loosely typed according to function and API behaviour of the language itself
    programming languages aren't just the API's

    Python object orientation functions in exactly the same way
    https://docs.python.org/3.12/library/collections.abc.html

    Same with PhP
    https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.object.php

    Same with Ruby
    http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_classes.html

    Same with Perl
    https://perldoc.perl.org/perlootut#Object

    Same with Haskell
    https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/monads.html

    things may be written in C++ but language derriving is directly from C

    even lower level Go
    https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin

    and objective-c which is not c++, but however is similar
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C

    same with new Swift
    https://developer.apple.com/swift/
    which is a mix of its own thing and JavaScript clone

    similarly with rust
    https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-02-example-structs.html

    and with ziglang
    https://ziglang.org

    all the same with Java which also has more of a sibling connection to C++ in regards to C
